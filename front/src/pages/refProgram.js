                                The trading volume is calculated for each pair, then all summarized.

                                Referral 1. One of your referrals has bought 1 BTC for a price of $4000, and then after 1 minute, sold it for a price of $4010. The value of the trades will be $8010. The total commission will be $20
                                Referral 2. Another of your referrals has traded on the pair ETH/USDT. And during the day he has bought and sold 10 ETH five times.

                                This means that, with an ETH price of $135, over the course of the day, the value of trades is $6750. The size of the commission paid is $16.87

                                This means that, for one day the volume of trades of all of your referrals will make up $14750. Throughout the week, with these trades, you will receive a total of $103,250 of trading value

                                The total amount of commission paid for the week is $258

                                Probably not. It depends on the size of the commission fee. If your referrals for the week have paid less than $1 in commission, then you will not receive anything.
